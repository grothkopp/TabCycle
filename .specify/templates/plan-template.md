# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

## Testing Strategy

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: For Chrome extension projects, this section MUST describe the
  testing approach at all three layers per constitution Principle I.
-->

### Unit Tests
[Pure logic modules tested with Jest. List modules and what they cover.]

### Integration Tests
[Storage, messaging, and cross-context behavior. List test files.]

### E2E Tests (Puppeteer + CDP)

<!--
  Per constitution §I, E2E tests MUST be included for Chrome extension projects.
  They launch a real Chrome instance with the extension loaded and verify actual
  outcomes via CDP. They are NOT part of the default test command.

  Document:
  - Which user stories / acceptance scenarios are covered by E2E tests
  - The harness architecture (keeper tab, state cleanup, deterministic eval triggering)
  - Any extension-side hooks exposed for testability (e.g., globalThis exports)
  - Known timing considerations (tab creation delays, threshold margins)
  - The command to run E2E tests (e.g., npm run test:e2e-chrome)
-->

**E2E test suites**: [List test files and what they cover]
**Run command**: `npm run test:e2e-chrome`
**When to run**: After core logic changes, Chrome API changes, before releases
(see constitution §I for full guidance)

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
